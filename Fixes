FIXES



Re-factored into classes.
Fixed training to go over all training instances.
Fixed a serious underflow issue that was causing division by zero errors all over the place.

Resulting algorithm seems to be working fine except I'm not sure that it is fast enough.
I created a small test set of 20 sentences to test and it still takes a few seconds to compute indicating that doing training over the entire set may be prohibitive as of now.
